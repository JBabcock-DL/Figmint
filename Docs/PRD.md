## 1. Executive Summary

DesignOps today is a set of Claude-driven skills that orchestrate Figma design system work via the MCP `use_figma` tool. The agent-driven approach delivers value but pays a heavy tax: a 50 kB MCP payload cap requires a multi-layer bundle-assembly + subagent transport apparatus, every variable push pays for LLM tokens, designers need Claude Code + MCP configured, and gotchas live as prompt-rules the model must remember.

This PRD specifies a replacement: a deterministic Figma plugin that runs inside the Figma sandbox, owns the bootstrap and context-bridge work natively (no LLM, no MCP transport), and is designed as a **deterministic context bridge between agents** — usable today with Claude (designer-mediated handoff), eventually with the Figma Agent if and when its surface allows, and gracefully deprecated as Figma ships native equivalents.

The plugin's center of gravity is bootstrap speed (design system setup measured in seconds, not minutes) and bidirectional context flow (Figma ↔ consumer repo) through versioned, agent-consumable JSON/Markdown documents.

## 2. Mission & Strategic Context

### 2.1 Mission Statement

> **FigHub is a deterministic context bridge between agents.** Zero LLM tokens consumed internally; first-class file I/O in both directions; agents are optional upstream/downstream users that the plugin is designed _for_ but does not depend _on_.

### 2.2 Why now

| Force                                                                                     | Implication                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Figma Agent launched May 2026 (free-form design, translations, quick edits)               | Pluggable LLM judgment slices can be deferred to Figma; we stop trying to own them |
| Figma Plugin API has full parity for variables, components, modes, bindings, Code Connect | Everything DesignOps does via MCP can be done natively                             |
| MCP transport layer is the largest source of complexity in the current repo               | Removing it deletes whole skill files and convention shards                        |
| Figma's Variables REST API gates writes to Enterprise plans                               | Plugin path avoids the plan gate; plugin sandbox uses free Plugin API              |

### 2.3 Strategic positioning vs. agents

The plugin assumes a future where free-form design judgment migrates to Figma Agent. Its job is the deterministic, repeatable scaffolding work that benefits from being code rather than prompt-driven:

- Pushing tokens into variables with correct modes and codeSyntax
- Building style-guide canvases that follow auto-layout invariants
- Scaffolding components with variant matrices and variable bindings
- Detecting drift across the design ↔ code boundary
- Capturing handoff context as portable documents

For everything else, the plugin produces context documents (Markdown + JSON) that designers carry to whichever agent makes sense — Claude today, Figma Agent later, none of them if Figma ships native versions.

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 UC-1: Greenfield design system bootstrap

**Actor:** Designer (Engineer prepared `tokens.json` upstream)
**Trigger:** New Figma file, no existing design system
**Outcome:** Full Figma file populated with 5 variable collections (Primitives, Theme, Typography, Layout, Effects), style-guide canvas pages (color, typography, layout, effects, token overview), audit report
**Latency target:** <30s end-to-end

### 5.2 UC-2: Add component (designer-led, registry pick)

**Actor:** Designer
**Trigger:** Designer needs a known component (e.g. shadcn Button)
**Outcome:** Component scaffolded on canvas with variant matrix and variable bindings; `.fighub-registry.json` updated via GitHub PR
**Latency target:** <5s scaffold time

### 5.3 UC-3: Add component (agent-emitted spec)

**Actor:** Designer + Claude (or future Figma Agent)
**Trigger:** Designer needs a component without a known spec
**Outcome:** Claude produces `component-spec.v1.json`; designer pastes / loads from clipboard; plugin scaffolds same as UC-2
**Latency target:** <3 designer clicks past agent conversation

### 5.4 UC-4: Import component from connected repo

**Actor:** Designer (Engineer authored the component in code)
**Trigger:** Component exists in code, not in Figma
**Outcome:** Plugin parses source file (React/Vue/WC/SwiftUI/Compose), produces `component-spec.v1.json`, pre-scans dependencies, designer reviews preview, scaffolds with sub-component instance references where registry matches
**Latency target:** <10s parse + preview; <5s scaffold after accept

### 5.5 UC-5: Bidirectional drift sync

**Actor:** Designer
**Trigger:** Designer opens plugin and sees `Sync · 4↑ 2↓` badge, or runs detect manually
**Outcome:** 3-way comparison surfaces push candidates (Figma → Repo), pull candidates (Repo → Figma), and conflicts (both changed since last sync); designer resolves per-drift; push emits GitHub PR; pull applies locally to Figma
**Latency target:** <2s detect; resolution UX bounded by designer review pace

### 5.6 UC-6: Dev handoff capture

**Actor:** Designer → consumer (Claude / Jira / GitHub)
**Trigger:** Designer ready to hand off a frame to engineering
**Outcome:** Plugin captures frame screenshot, URL, components used (with Code Connect URLs if mapped), tokens referenced, auto-layout metadata; emits `handoff-context.v1.{json,md}`; designer routes via clipboard / GitHub PR / canvas Output page / pluginData
**Latency target:** <1s capture

### 5.7 UC-7: Code Connect mapping emission

**Actor:** Designer initiates; Engineer reviews; CI publishes
**Trigger:** Components on canvas without code mappings
**Outcome:** Plugin detects unmapped, generates per-framework stub files, opens GitHub PR to consumer repo; engineer fills implementation references; CI runs `figma connect publish` on merge
**Latency target:** <5s stub generation for ~10 components

### 7.4 Cross-repo contract package

`@detroitlabs/fighub-contracts` is published from the new repo and consumed by both:

- The plugin itself
- Any CLI / CI tooling that validates contract documents
- The current `DesignOps-plugin` repo's skills during sunset (so Claude-side consumers can validate inputs/outputs)

Single source of truth for schemas. Bumping a schema is a coordinated package version bump.

---

## 8. Data Contracts

Five document types. Each has a `v1` JSON schema and a derived GFM markdown rendering. Markdown is generated from JSON; never authored separately.

### 8.1 `ops-program.v1`

**Direction:** Input
**Purpose:** "Run these operations against the current Figma file"
**Consumers:** Plugin
**Producers:** Plugin UI (from forms), Claude, future Figma Skill, CLI

```jsonc
{
  "v": 1,
  "kind": "ops-program",
  "meta": { "generatedAt": "ISO-8601", "generatedBy": "claude|designer|cli|figma-agent" },
  "ops": [
    { "type": "push-tokens", "source": { "kind": "inline", "tokens": {...} } },
    { "type": "build-style-guide", "pages": ["color","typography","layout","effects","overview"] },
    { "type": "scaffold-component", "spec": { /* component-spec.v1 */ } },
    { "type": "import-component", "repoPath": "src/components/Button.tsx" },
    { "type": "detect-drift", "scope": ["variables","components"] },
    { "type": "apply-resolution", "decisions": [ { "id": "...", "action": "push|pull|skip" } ] },
    { "type": "emit-handoff", "selection": [ "nodeId..." ] },
    { "type": "emit-code-connect-pr", "components": [ "name..." ], "framework": "react|vue|wc|swiftui|compose" }
  ]
}
```

### 8.2 `tokens` (hybrid: W3C DTCG **or** legacy)

**Direction:** Input
**Purpose:** Source of truth for design tokens
**Detection rules:** `$value`/`$type` keys → W3C DTCG. Detroit Labs Foundations legacy token shape (carried forward from the `DesignOps-plugin` workflow) → legacy adapter. Ambiguous → error with hint.
**Normalization:** Both formats convert to canonical internal token model before reaching core.

### 8.3 `component-spec.v1`

**Direction:** Input
**Purpose:** Declarative description of a component sufficient to scaffold it
**Consumers:** Plugin scaffold engine
**Producers:** Plugin UI, Claude, plugin importer (from code), hand-authored

```jsonc
{
  "v": 1,
  "kind": "component-spec",
  "name": "Button",
  "framework": "react",
  "variantMatrix": {
    "variant": ["primary", "secondary", "ghost"],
    "size": ["sm", "md", "lg"],
    "disabled": [false, true],
  },
  "props": [{ "name": "loading", "type": "boolean", "default": false }],
  "bindings": [
    { "selector": "root.fill", "variable": "Theme/Primary" },
    { "selector": "label.text", "variable": "Typography/Body/medium" },
  ],
  "layout": {
    "direction": "horizontal",
    "gap": "Layout/spacing/2",
    "padding": "Layout/spacing/3",
    "sizing": { "horizontal": "hug", "vertical": "hug" },
  },
  "subComponents": [{ "name": "Icon", "registryRef": "Icon" }],
  "confidence": {
    "layout": "high|medium|low",
    "bindings": "high|medium|low",
    "unresolved": ["bg-muted/40"],
  },
}
```

### 8.4 `drift-report.v1`

**Direction:** Output
**Purpose:** Bidirectional diff with push/pull/conflict classification
**Consumers:** Designer (in plugin UI), Claude, future Figma Agent, engineers (via PR)
**Producers:** Plugin drift detector

```jsonc
{
  "v": 1,
  "kind": "drift-report",
  "meta": { "generatedAt": "ISO-8601", "figmaFileKey": "...", "repoUrl": "..." },
  "summary": { "push": 4, "pull": 2, "conflict": 1, "synced": 410 },
  "drifts": [
    {
      "id": "primitives/color/blue-500",
      "kind": "variable",
      "direction": "push",
      "figma": "#2563EB",
      "repo": "#3B82F6",
      "lastSynced": "#3B82F6",
    },
    {
      "id": "components/Button",
      "kind": "component",
      "direction": "push",
      "figma": {
        "variantMatrix": {
          /* with new "loading" */
        },
      },
      "repo": {
        "variantMatrix": {
          /* without */
        },
      },
      "lastSynced": {
        /* matches repo */
      },
    },
    {
      "id": "typography/body/size",
      "kind": "variable",
      "direction": "conflict",
      "figma": 16,
      "repo": 15,
      "lastSynced": 14,
    },
  ],
}
```

Markdown rendering uses `## Push (4)`, `## Pull (2)`, `## Conflicts (1)` headings with `↑ ↓ ⚠` icons.

### 8.5 `handoff-context.v1`

**Direction:** Output
**Purpose:** Self-contained handoff packet for engineering
**Consumers:** Claude (ticket creation), engineers (Slack/Jira), future Figma Agent
**Producers:** Plugin handoff capture

```jsonc
{
  "v": 1,
  "kind": "handoff-context",
  "meta": { "capturedAt": "ISO-8601", "figmaFileKey": "...", "frameUrl": "..." },
  "frames": [
    {
      "nodeId": "12:34",
      "name": "Checkout",
      "deepLink": "https://figma.com/...?node-id=12:34",
      "screenshot": { "format": "png", "dataUrl": "data:image/png;base64,..." },
    },
  ],
  "components": [{ "name": "Button", "instances": 4, "codeConnectUrl": "..." }],
  "tokensUsed": ["Theme/Primary", "Layout/spacing/3"],
  "autoLayout": { "direction": "vertical", "gap": "Layout/spacing/4" },
}
```

### 8.6 `registry.v1` (`.fighub-registry.json`)

**Direction:** Both (read for context, write on scaffold/import/sync)
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for what components exist in both Figma and code
**Schema:** TBD in Phase 2; carry forward the proven shape from the legacy `DesignOps-plugin` registry, formalized with explicit v1 versioning

---

## 9. Operations Protocol

The ops protocol is the contract between any **shell** (UI, agent, CLI) and the deterministic core. A program is a versioned JSON object containing an array of typed operations. The dispatcher parses, validates against schema, then routes each op to the appropriate core function.

### 9.1 Why ops-JSON over direct function calls

| Property                                         | Direct calls                          | Ops JSON                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Replayable / auditable                           | No                                    | Yes — drop a `.fighub.ops.json` next to the file             |
| Agent-friendly                                   | Moderate — agents write code OK       | Best fit — JSON emission is well-trained                      |
| Inter-runtime portable                           | No — TS functions can't cross sandbox | Yes — JSON crosses any boundary                               |
| Bridges "external agent can't invoke plugin" gap | No                                    | Yes — agent writes to canvas pluginData, plugin reads on open |

### 9.2 Op type categories

| Category     | Op types                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Bootstrap    | `push-tokens`, `build-style-guide`       |
| Components   | `scaffold-component`, `import-component` |
| Drift        | `detect-drift`, `apply-resolution`       |
| Handoff      | `emit-handoff`                           |
| Code Connect | `emit-code-connect-pr`                   |

Each op has a typed payload (validated against `@detroitlabs/fighub-contracts`) and a typed return result included in the audit log.

### 9.3 Execution semantics

- Ops execute sequentially unless explicitly marked parallel-safe
- Each op produces a result entry in the run's audit log
- A failed op halts the program; partial state is reported
- All writes are wrapped in a single `figma.commitUndo` boundary so designer can undo a whole run

## 10. I/O Subsystem

### 10.1 Sources (input)

| Source                        | Use case                                                               | Phase   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |

| File picker / drag-drop       | Local file from disk (.json or .md)                                    | 1       |
| Clipboard auto-detect on open | Plugin sniffs clipboard for valid contract JSON, offers "Load?" banner | 1       |
| GitHub OAuth pull (read)      | Plugin pulls tokens / spec / config from connected repo                | 1 (Org) |
| Frame pluginData              | Upstream agent dropped ops via MCP write-to-canvas                     | 3       |

### 10.2 Sinks (output)

| Sink                          | Use case                                                         | Phase   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Download as `.json` / `.md`   | Designer carries file manually                                   | 1       |
| Copy to clipboard             | Most common — paste to chat/ticket/agent                         | 1       |
| FigHub Output page text node | Persistent labeled node; agent with file access can read via MCP | 3       |
| Frame pluginData              | Compact machine-readable handoff for round-trips                 | 3       |
| GitHub PR (write via OAuth)   | Engineer-reviewable, mergeable change to consumer repo           | 3 (Org) |

### 10.3 Dual-format serialization

Every contract document is emitted as **both** `.v1.json` and `.v1.md`:

- **JSON** is for machines: CI validators, strict schema consumers, agent ingestion
- **Markdown** is for humans and agents in chat: GitHub PR rendering, Claude chat, Figma canvas Output page

Markdown is generated from the JSON in `src/io/formats/markdown.ts`. The two can never diverge because there's only one source. GFM tables + headings, no exotic syntax.

### 10.4 Unified export sheet

Single component used across all flows:

```
┌─ Export drift-report ──────────────────────┐
│  Format:  [● JSON]  [● Markdown]  (both)   │
│                                             │

## 11. Non-Functional Requirements

### 11.1 Performance

| Operation                                    | Target                 | Baseline (current MCP path) |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Full bootstrap (5 collections + style guide) | <30s                   | 5–15 min                    |
| Component scaffold (one component)           | <5s                    | 3–8 min                     |
| Drift detection                              | <2s                    | 2–5 min                     |
| Handoff capture                              | <1s                    | 1–3 min                     |
| Code Connect stub PR (10 components)         | <5s + GitHub roundtrip | 10+ min (multi-agent-turn)  |

### 11.2 Determinism

- No LLM calls inside plugin
- No randomness in canvas placement (deterministic layout algorithms)
- Same input → same output across runs

### 11.3 Security

- No API keys or secrets in plugin bundle
- GitHub OAuth via standard flow; tokens stored in clientStorage scoped per repo URL (acknowledged: clientStorage is inspectable; OAuth tokens are revocable and limited-scope)
- No third-party network calls beyond GitHub API and Figma Plugin API
- `manifest.networkAccess.allowedDomains`: GitHub only

### 11.4 Determinism failure modes

When something can't be done deterministically (e.g. component import layout inference is uncertain), the plugin:

1. Flags the uncertainty in the preview
2. Requires explicit designer confirmation before proceeding
3. Records the decision in the audit log

Never silent-applies a guess.

### 11.5 Compatibility

- Figma Plugin API current as of 2026-05-26
- Targets Extended Variable Collections (Plugin API Update 121, 2025-11-20) **on Enterprise-tier files only** if Phase 0 spike validates (see §13.1; EVC `VariableCollection.extend()` throws on lower plans)
- **Node 22 LTS** for build tooling (bumped from Node 20 — Node 20 reached EOL 2026-04-30; WO-003's `ts-json-schema-generator@2.x` requires ≥22; WO-004's ESLint 10 + typescript-eslint v8 toolchain prefers Node 22+)
- TypeScript strict mode

### 11.6 Internationalization

Plugin UI text in English only for v1. Designer-facing copy stored centrally to allow future localization.

---

## 12. Phasing & Milestones

### Phase 0 — Spike (1–2 days)

**Goal:** Validate platform assumptions before committing

- Single-screen plugin pushes one collection from pasted `tokens.json`
- Validate Extended Variable Collections semantics vs. current 5-collection design
- Measure bootstrap latency vs. MCP baseline
- **Exit criteria:** Latency target G1 looks achievable; no platform blockers

### Phase 1 — Bootstrap core + I/O foundation

**Goal:** Headline value — fast bootstrap from any input

- Full 5-collection push with modes + codeSyntax
- Style-guide canvas builders (color, typography, layout, effects, overview)
- Auto-layout / resize helpers encoding gotchas as code
- I/O sources: paste, file picker, clipboard auto-detect, GitHub OAuth pull (Org build)
- Audit reporting
- **Exit criteria:** G1 met; design system bootstrap demoed end-to-end

### Phase 2 — Component scaffold (forward path)

**Goal:** Add components from spec / registry

- ComponentSet creation with variant matrix
- Variable bindings applied
- Component property definitions
- Usage frame generation
- Registry update output via any sink
- **Exit criteria:** G2 met; UC-2 and UC-3 pass

### Phase 3 — Context export + drift sync

**Goal:** Bidirectional context flow; the agent-bridge story becomes real

- Drift detector (variables + components)
- 3-way snapshot mechanism (canvas pluginData)
- Push / Pull / Conflict resolution UI
- Handoff context capture
- All 4 output sinks wired up
- Markdown rendering for all contract types
- **Exit criteria:** G3 met; UC-5 and UC-6 pass; conflicts resolve correctly

### Phase 4 — Code Connect + Component import

Sub-phased to ship per-framework:

#### 4a — React

- `MappingTemplate` interface
- `ImportTemplate` interface (shared parser infra)
- React Code Connect stub generator
- React `importFromCode` (TS AST → component-spec)
- Token resolver: Tailwind v3/v4 + CSS vars
- Dependency scanner

#### 4b — Vue + Web Components

- Vue SFC parser
- Custom Elements Manifest parser
- Shared web token resolver

#### 4c — SwiftUI + Compose

- Swift parser
- Kotlin parser
- Native asset catalog resolver (different token model)

**Exit criteria:** G4 met per framework; UC-4 and UC-7 pass

### Phase 5 — Sunset of current repo

Parallel with Phase 4. See §17.

## 13. Distribution Strategy & Feature Gating

### 13.1 Two build targets, one codebase

| Extended Variable Collections projector (theme inheritance) | ❌            | ✅ (Enterprise-tier Figma files only — `VariableCollection.extend()` is plan-gated) |

### 13.2 Mechanism

Single TS codebase. Build-time constants injected via `src/config/flags.{community,org}.ts`. Two manifests: `manifest.community.json` and `manifest.org.json`. UI affordances gated at the component level. Same code paths, gated visibility.

### 13.3 Distribution channels

- **Community build:** Figma Community plugin listing, public, free, zero-config
- **Org build:** Private installation via Detroit Labs Figma org; configured for client engagements

## 17. Sunset Plan for DesignOps-plugin Repo

The current repo enters managed sunset starting at plugin Phase 3 GA. The repo doesn't die — it shrinks to a focused **agent-side companion** to the plugin.

### 17.1 Skill-by-skill disposition

| Skill                  | Action at Plugin GA                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new-project`          | Replaced. Skill becomes 1-line redirect: "Install the plugin."                                                                   |
| `create-design-system` | Replaced. Same redirect.                                                                                                         |
| `create-component`     | Forward path replaced by plugin. shadcn-install side stays as CLI / Claude skill until that moves to a dedicated CLI.            |
| `sync-design-system`   | Becomes a thin Claude skill consuming `drift-report.v1.md`. Plugin detects; Claude orchestrates `AskUserQuestion` for conflicts. |
| `dev-handoff`          | Becomes thin Claude skill consuming `handoff-context.v1.md` to create the ticket via `gh` / Jira.                                |
| `code-connect`         | Replaced by plugin's PR-emission flow + CI publish.                                                                              |
| `accessibility-check`  | Deprecated; pointer to Figma Agent.                                                                                              |
| `new-language`         | Deprecated; pointer to Figma Agent.                                                                                              |
| `canvas-bundle-runner` | Hard-deleted (no 50k cap inside plugin).                                                                                         |

### 17.2 Hard-delete list

- `scripts/assemble-component-use-figma-code.mjs`
- `scripts/check-payload.mjs`
- `scripts/check-use-figma-args.mjs`
- `scripts/probe-parent-transport.mjs`
- `scripts/sync-cache.sh` + `~/.claude/plugins/...` cache mirror
- `skills/canvas-bundle-runner/`
- `AGENTS.md` MCP anti-spiral section (most of it)
- `canvas-templates/bundles/*.min.mcp.js` (lifted into plugin as TS modules)
- `memory.md` MCP / payload sections

### 17.3 Sunset PR

A single dedicated PR after Plugin Phase 3 ships:

- Removes the items in §17.2
- Rewrites surviving skills as plugin-output consumers
- Updates `CLAUDE.md` / `memory.md` to point at the plugin
- Marks deprecated skills with redirect
